Made up of key value pairs
- Objects are made up of key-value pairs know as properties.
- All object keys are automatically converted to strings (unless using `Symbol`). So key 123 is internally converted to "123". With [] notation it accepts expressions which are evaulated and converted to string. 
- So accessing obj[123] converts to obj["123"].

```javascript
let obj = {};
obj[123] = "number";
console.log(obj["123"]); // "number"
```

3 ways to create:

	1. Using object literal
	2. Empty object and then adding properties
	3. using new keyword


```javascript
const Person = {
	name:"Dr Jack",
	age:19 
}

let obj = new Object();
obj.name = "Adil";
obj.age = 23;
```

### Way of accessing [] vs .

[] and . both provide a way to access value using keys. [] can be used to access the dynamic keys.
. operator only works if key has no space.

```javascript
let key = "full name";
console.log(obj[key]); // "Adil"

// adding property
obj[key] = val;
// delete a property
delete obj[key];
// check if property exist or not
key in obj
```

When using dot notation(.) to access values in objects, it requires a valid property name after the dot. While using the bracket notation([ ]), we can pass expressions between the brackets which are evaluated to get the property name.

```javascript
// valid
obj.name
// invalid
obj.1
//valid
obj[1]
```

#### Object destructuring

Object destructuring assigns the properties of an object to variables with the same names by default.

```javascript
let {firstName , lastName , position, email} = obj;
```

typeof in JavaScript is an operator used for type checking and returns a string indicating the data type of the expression written in front of it.

```javascript
console.log(typeof x);
// gives type of object
```
