In AWS, **managed databases** refer to services like Amazon RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, and ElastiCache, where AWS handles the operational aspects such as provisioning, patching, backups, monitoring, and scaling, allowing users to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management. In contrast, **unmanaged databases** (e.g., running MySQL or PostgreSQL on EC2) require users to manually install, configure, and maintain the database, including updates, backups, replication, and failover setups, giving more control and flexibility but demanding more effort and expertise.


**Amazon RDS:**  

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a fully managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud. It supports several database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server. RDS automates common administrative tasks like backups, patching, monitoring, and scaling, allowing developers to focus more on their applications.

**Database Instances:**  

In Amazon RDS, a database instance is an isolated database environment running in the cloud. Each instance includes the database engine, storage, and compute capacity and can host one or more databases. AWS provides a variety of instance types optimized for memory, performance, or I/O, and users can choose single or multi-AZ deployments for availability and durability.


**Storage on Amazon RDS:**  

RDS uses Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes for database and log storage. Amazon RDS provides three types of storage: General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic (legacy). Users select storage based on performance and cost needs, with support for automatic scaling of storage capacity. RDS automatically manages the underlying storage, including redundancy and data replication, to ensure high durability and availability.

**RDS in VPC:**  

Amazon RDS can be launched inside an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), allowing users to isolate their databases and control network access using security groups, subnets, and routing tables. With VPC, RDS instances can be placed in private subnets, enabling secure communication between application servers and the database without exposing it to the public internet.

**Backup Data:**  

Amazon RDS provides automated backups and the ability to take manual snapshots of database instances. Automated backups are enabled by default and allow point-in-time recovery within a specified retention period (up to 35 days). Backups are stored in Amazon S3, ensuring durability and high availability, and they do not affect the performance of the primary database.

**Multi-AZ:**  

Multi-AZ deployments in Amazon RDS provide high availability and failover support for production databases. AWS automatically creates a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone, and in case of a failure of the primary instance, RDS automatically fails over to the standby with minimal downtime. This ensures greater fault tolerance without manual intervention.

**Security:**  

Security in Amazon RDS is enforced through multiple layers, including network isolation using VPC, access control with IAM, encryption at rest using AWS KMS, and encryption in transit using SSL/TLS. Users can manage who has access to the database instances, audit activity with CloudTrail, and use security groups and parameter groups to configure fine-grained controls.


### Dynamo DB:

**Amazon DynamoDB** is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS that delivers fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It is designed for key-value and document data models and supports both single-digit millisecond latency and automatic scaling. DynamoDB is serverlessâ€”there are no servers to manage, and it handles replication, patching, and fault tolerance automatically. It supports built-in security, backup and restore, in-memory caching with DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator), and fine-grained access control using IAM. DynamoDB is ideal for use cases requiring high throughput and low latency, such as real-time applications, gaming, IoT, and e-commerce.

### Elastic Cache:

In memory caching solution. Supports two cache engines - Redis and memcached. 

### Memory DB:

**Amazon MemoryDB for Redis** is a fully managed, Redis-compatible, in-memory database service designed for ultra-fast performance and **durability**. Unlike typical in-memory caches, MemoryDB stores data across multiple Availability Zones with **multi-AZ replication and a durable transaction log**, making it suitable not just for caching but also as a **primary database** for low-latency applications. It supports high availability, encryption, backups, and fine-grained access controls.

Use **MemoryDB** when you need an **in-memory database with durability and high availability**; use **ElastiCache** when you need a **fast, cost-effective cache** to reduce load on primary databases.

#### Amazon DocumentDB

Amazon DocumentDB is a fully managed document database service that supports JSON-like document storage and is designed to be compatible with MongoDB. It enables scalable and high-performance operations for document-based applications while taking care of infrastructure tasks like backups, patching, and replication. DocumentDB supports dynamic schemas and is ideal for content management systems, catalogs, and user profiles that require flexible data models.

#### Amazon Keyspaces

Amazon Keyspaces is a scalable, serverless, and fully managed database service compatible with Apache Cassandra. It allows users to run Cassandra workloads on AWS without managing infrastructure, offering automatic scaling, on-demand capacity, and high availability. Keyspaces is suited for time-series data, IoT, and messaging applications that require fast, distributed NoSQL storage.

#### Amazon Neptune

Amazon Neptune is a fully managed graph database service optimized for storing and querying highly connected data. It supports popular graph models like Property Graph and RDF and query languages like Gremlin and SPARQL. Neptune is used in applications like recommendation engines, fraud detection, and knowledge graphs, where relationships between data points are crucial.

#### Amazon Timestream

Amazon Timestream is a serverless, time series database service optimized for storing and analyzing time-stamped data such as metrics and events. It automatically manages data lifecycle, moving recent data to memory and older data to cost-efficient storage. Timestream is ideal for IoT applications, DevOps monitoring, and analytics on temporal data, enabling fast queries with minimal operational overhead.



### Dynamo DB:

Dynamo DB is fullly managaed NoSql database that provides fast and predictable performance with seemless scalability. It is fast and highly available.

Core of Dynamo DB is:

1. Tables: COllection of items.
2. Items: Each item is a collection of attributes. Dynamo DB can uniquely identify each item in table by primary keys.
3. Attribute: Key and value pair.
