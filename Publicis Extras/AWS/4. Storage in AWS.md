1. File storage -> Data stored in files as hierarchy
2. Block storage -> Data stored in fixed size blocks 
3. Object storage -> Data stored as objects in bucket.

In file storage file is treated as single unit but in block storage we split files into multiple fixed size chunks. Each block has some address and by using it any block can be retrieved efficiently. Block storage are used for low latency operations.

Object sotrage much like file storage treats each file as single entity but instad of storing in hierarical fashion it is stored in flat structure. Each object has unique identifier. For eg changing one char in file in object storage requires us to update entire object. 

Object storage is used to store large unstructured objects. Eg backups and rich media.

### ðŸ”¹ What are AWS EFS and FSx?

**Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)** is a fully managed, **serverless** shared file storage system for use with **Linux** workloads. It provides **NFSv4-compatible** file storage that can automatically scale, supports concurrent access from thousands of EC2 instances, and is ideal for shared web content, analytics, and container workloads (e.g., EKS, ECS).

**Amazon FSx** is a family of managed **Windows or high-performance file systems**, offering more specialized file storage. The most common options are:

- **FSx for Windows File Server** (SMB protocol, Active Directory integration)
- **FSx for Lustre** (high-throughput, low-latency file system for HPC, ML, and big data)
### ðŸ”¸ Key Differences

EFS is ideal for **Linux-based, general-purpose** workloads needing a simple shared file system with scalability and durability, while FSx is designed for **specific enterprise or performance-heavy use cases**â€”like Windows apps needing SMB support or HPC workloads needing Lustre performance.

In short: **use EFS for Linux and container apps needing easy shared storage**, and **use FSx when you need Windows-native features or high-performance file systems** like Lustre.

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Amazon Instance Store

Amazon Instance Store provides **temporary block-level storage** for EC2 instances. The storage is physically attached to the host machine, offering very **high IOPS** and **low latency**, making it suitable for **buffering, caching, or temporary data**. However, data in instance store **is lost when the instance stops, terminates, or fails**, and it cannot be detached or persisted like EBS. Itâ€™s available only for specific EC2 instance types and must be used when you need fast, ephemeral storage with no long-term retention needs.

Amazon EC2 Instance Store provides temporary, high-performance block-level storage that is physically attached to the host computer running your EC2 instance. This type of storage is often referred to as ephemeral storage because the data does not persist if the instance is stopped, terminated, or fails. It is ideal for temporary data such as caches, buffers, scratch data, or data that is replicated across nodes in a distributed system. 

Instance store volumes offer **very low latency and high IOPS**, making them suitable for performance-intensive workloads. However, they come with significant limitations: you **cannot detach** them from the instance, **cannot resize** them independently, and **data is lost** on reboot (for some types), stop, or termination. Only certain EC2 instance types (like `i3`, `d2`, `h1`, etc.) support instance store volumes, and their size and number are fixed based on the instance type.
### ðŸ”¹ 2. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

Amazon EBS offers **persistent, block-level storage volumes** for use with EC2 instances. Unlike instance store, EBS volumes are **network-attached**, can be **detached and re-attached** to other instances, and **retain data even after instance termination** (unless explicitly deleted). EBS supports encryption, backups, and snapshots, and can be used for a wide range of applicationsâ€”from boot volumes to large-scale databasesâ€”with options for performance tuning via **Provisioned IOPS** or **General Purpose SSDs**.

Additonally EBS has two kinds of volumes:

1. SSD : Ideal for frequent read/ write operations. 
2. HDD: Ideal for large streaming workloads with high throughput.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Amazon EBS Snapshot

An Amazon EBS Snapshot is a **point-in-time backup** of an EBS volume, stored in Amazon S3 (internally managed by AWS). Snapshots are **incremental**, meaning only the changed blocks are stored after the first snapshot, which saves on storage cost. They can be used to **create new EBS volumes**, restore volumes across availability zones or regions, and serve as part of a disaster recovery strategy. Snapshots also enable automated backup scheduling and lifecycle management through AWS Backup.

## S3

### Amazon S3 and Buckets

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a fully managed, highly scalable, and durable object storage service designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Data in S3 is organized into **buckets**, which act as containers for storing objects (files and their metadata). Each bucket must have a globally unique name and can contain an unlimited number of objects. S3 is often used for backup, content distribution, data lakes, and static website hosting due to its high availability and strong durability (99.999999999%).
### Object Names

In S3, each object is identified by a **key** (object name), which must be unique within a bucket. Object names can be up to 1,024 characters long and can include slashes (`/`), which allow users to simulate a folder-like hierarchy even though S3 is a flat storage system. For example, `images/2025/photo.jpg` is a valid object key that appears to reside in a directory structure. Object names are critical for organization, access control, and lifecycle management.
### Security in S3

Amazon S3 provides multiple layers of security to protect data. At the object and bucket level, **server-side encryption** can automatically encrypt data at rest using AWS-managed keys (SSE-S3), customer-managed keys (SSE-KMS), or customer-provided keys (SSE-C). For data in transit, S3 supports **HTTPS-based encryption**. Access to S3 is controlled using **IAM policies**, **bucket policies**, **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, and **pre-signed URLs**, allowing fine-grained permission management.
### S3 and IAM Policies

IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies define what actions a user or role can perform on S3 resources. These **identity-based policies** are attached to IAM users, groups, or roles, and they define permissions like uploading, listing, or deleting objects in specified buckets. IAM policies support conditions (e.g., time-based access, IP restriction) and can be used alongside S3â€™s resource-based policies to enforce strict access controls.
### S3 Bucket Policies

Bucket policies are **resource-based policies** applied directly to an S3 bucket to control access at the bucket level. They are written in JSON and define who can perform what actions (like `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`) on the bucket and its contents. Bucket policies are especially useful for enabling cross-account access, setting up public read access (e.g., for static websites), or enforcing security standards like denying unencrypted uploads.
### S3 Versioning

S3 Versioning enables you to **preserve, retrieve, and restore** every version of every object stored in a bucket. When versioning is enabled, S3 keeps all versions of an object, even if itâ€™s deleted or overwritten. This feature is useful for data protection, undoing accidental deletes or overwrites, and meeting compliance requirements. Once versioning is turned on for a bucket, it cannot be disabledâ€”only suspended.
### Storage Lifecycle

S3 lifecycle policies allow you to automatically transition objects between storage classes or delete them based on rules you define. For example, you can move infrequently accessed data to S3 Glacier for archival after 30 days or delete old versions after 365 days. Lifecycle policies help reduce storage costs and maintain data hygiene, especially in buckets that store large volumes of time-sensitive or rarely accessed data.
