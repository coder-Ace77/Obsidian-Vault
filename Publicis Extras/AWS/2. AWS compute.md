Server hosts an application. Client is a person/ computer that sends a request. Servers provide us CPU memory and network capacity. On AWS to run a http server find a service that provides a compute power. 

Eg: EC2 , Lambda etc.

### Three fundamental services:

1. VMs - Instances of Compute -> Provides physical server. EC2
2. Containers - 
3. Serverless

### EC2:

Bills per hour.

Creation of an EC2 instance can be done through console , CLI or SDks, automation tools and infra services.
Following must defined to call an EC2 instance:

1. Hardware specs: cpu , mem and storage.
2. Logical: Networking location, firewall rules and OS.

#### AMI amazon machine image:

It contains the image of an OS. This OS will be installed on your instance.
Relationship between AMI and EC2: Its like class and object.

Amazon provides AMI there are custom and community AMI also. Each ami has ami id:  format-> ami-hash

EC2 has many instance types - they define the cpu , memory , network of VM. They have specific name and carry some meaning 

Format : instance family generation   attribute .  Instance size -> c5n.xlarge

Instance families:

	1. General purpose - for web server 
	2. Compute optimised - 
	3. Memory optimised
	4. Storage optimised

#### EC2 instance locations:

By default Ec2 instances are placed in default virtual private cloud(vpc). Any resource put inside here is accessible by internet. One can also choose custom vpc and with restricted access.


#### EC2 lifecycle:

1. When launched -> pending state. Here its preparing to enter running stage.
2. Running -> ready to use. BIlling starts. 
3. Rebooting -> Rebooting OS. Instance keeps its IPv4 and IPv6 address.
4. Stopping and stopped -> Shut down. Keeps IPv4 and IPv6
5. Terminate -> Instance stored is erased and loose IPs

Stop and stop hibernate: In stop ram data is lost but in hibernate its stored in ebs volume.



### Containers:

Container is a standard unit that contains code and its dependencies. The package is designed to run reialbily on any platform because container creates its own independent env.

Containers can spin up faster than VMs they are also lighter. Container can be placed in an EC2 instance also. 

Managing containers with Amazon elastic container service(ECS). Now one can manage contaiers themselves or with AWS service called AWS Fargate. EC2 instance with container agent is called container instance. To prepare application to run on ECS weneed to create task definition. ITs a text file, in JSON format that describes a container.

Similery Amazon EKS - Elastic Kubernetes service is an orchestration tool to orchestrate work loads in AWS cloud. 

### Serverless:

**Serverless computing** in AWS lets you **build and run applications without provisioning or managing servers**. You focus on your code and business logic; AWS handles the infrastructure.
Eg : AWS Fargate and AWS lambda

##### Fargate: (Serverless containers):

It is purpose built serverless compute engine for containers. It allocates right amount of compute. 

##### Lambda:

With lambda one can run code without managing servers. Yuo can run code for any kind of backend service. Idea is to upload code in one language that lambda supports and done.

It bills when yuo use the service. 

| Term                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Function**                      | The AWS Lambda **unit of execution**. It includes your code + configuration (memory, timeout, environment variables, etc.). Think of it like a “microservice” unit.                                 |
| **Trigger**                       | A **source of events** that invokes your Lambda function. Examples: S3 (on file upload), API Gateway (on HTTP request), DynamoDB Streams, EventBridge, CloudWatch Events, etc.                      |
| **Event**                         | The **data payload** sent to your function when it's triggered. It's passed as the first parameter to your handler. Example: S3 event data when a file is uploaded.                                 |
| **Handler**                       | The **entry point** of your Lambda function. It’s a method or function that AWS calls when the function is invoked. Format: `file_name.method_name` (e.g., `app.lambda_handler`).                   |
| **Runtime**                       | The **language environment** your code runs in. Examples: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET. AWS provides and manages the runtime.                                                              |
| **Deployment Package**            | A **.zip or container** that includes your Lambda function code and dependencies. This is what you upload to AWS to deploy your function.                                                           |
| **Environment Variables**         | Key-value pairs you can use to **configure your function without changing code** (e.g., database URL, API keys).                                                                                    |
| **Application** _(optional term)_ | A **logical group** of Lambda functions and resources, often defined using tools like AWS SAM or Serverless Framework. Not a native Lambda concept, but useful for organizing serverless solutions. |
