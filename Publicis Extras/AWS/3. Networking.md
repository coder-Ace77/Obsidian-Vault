AWS **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is a foundational networking service in Amazon Web Services that allows you to **create a logically isolated network** within the AWS cloud, where you can launch AWS resources like EC2 instances, databases, and containers.

| Component                  | Description                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Subnet**                 | Subdivision of a VPC. Can be public or private. Public subnets have access to the internet, private ones do not. |
| **Route Table**            | Controls how traffic is directed within the VPC. Each subnet must be associated with a route table.              |
| **Internet Gateway (IGW)** | Connects the VPC to the internet. Required for public subnets.                                                   |
| **NAT Gateway/Instance**   | Allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet without exposing them to inbound traffic.        |
| **Security Groups**        | Virtual firewalls attached to instances, controlling **inbound/outbound traffic**.                               |
| **Network ACLs**           | Optional stateless firewalls for subnets, allow or deny traffic at the subnet level.                             |
| **CIDR Block**             | IP range for your VPC (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`). You can divide this into smaller subnet CIDRs.                      |

Each subnet has following:

1. VPC it lives in 
2. Availablity zone it lives in
3. IPv4 CIDR block of subnet which must be subnet of VPC CIDR block. 
One can create two subnets configured in two Availabily zones.
#### Reserved IPs

In AWS **VPC**, several **IP addresses are reserved** within each **subnet** and **CIDR block** for internal networking purposes. These reserved IPs **cannot be assigned to EC2 instances or other resources**.

|IP Address|Reserved For|
|---|---|
|`10.0.1.0`|**Network address** (not usable)|
|`10.0.1.1`|**Reserved for the VPC router**|
|`10.0.1.2`|**Reserved for AWS DNS** (unless you use custom DNS)|
|`10.0.1.3`|Reserved for **future use**|
|`10.0.1.255`|**Broadcast address** (not used, but still reserved in AWS)|

Just like moderm is point through which local network is connected to outside world. Gateway has similar functionality and is connected to VPC. Virtual private gateway -> Connects your VPC to another private network. 

#### Idea of main routing table:

When you create a VPC a single routing table is created in each VPC. This defines how internet will flow between subnets. By default it allows internet traffic to flow between all VPC's.


#### ACL - Access control list: 

Works as virtual firewall at subnet level. It defines what kind of traffic is allowed to enter or leave the subnet.

Securing EC2 instances through security group. One can create cirtual firewall call security group. Default config of security gp blocks all inbound traffic and allows all inbound traffic.
